There are few other errors by students which are mentioned below such as unnecessary text, .zip file submission etc. Please don't repeat this going forward. For this homework I am not deducting any marks for this errors.


Common Errors:

Files named incorrectly, ie "diagram.pdf" instead of "diagramPDF.pdf" and "text.rtf" instead of "text.txt"

Files compressed as .zip

Constraints are deleted from ER01.text file

Two versions of PDF submitted

Unnecessary text with (irrelevant symbols) submitted in text.txt file

N-Number instead of NetId

Created an ER diagram for the application described in 4(b) instead of reproducing the diagram given in file "ER01.pdf"

Did not reproduce the diagram correctly. These error include, but are not limited to:

	- Missing underlines for 'A'
	- Neglecting to double underline 'J'.
	- Incorrect labeling for example 'K' instead of 'M'
	- Weak Entity is incorrect (no thick outline)
